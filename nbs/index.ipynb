They provide a clear \"Follow the Money\" breakdown showing that the $30 is distributed as $25 (hotel), $2 (bellboy), and $3 (guests). They correctly state that the $27 spent by the guests *already includes* the $2 held by the bellboy.\n",
      "2.  **Candidate 2 Analysis:** This candidate identifies the \"false premise\" and \"incorrect logic\" of the riddle. Like Candidate 1, they break down the $30 correctly and explain that the riddle incorrectly adds a \"cost\" ($27) to a \"profit\" ($2) instead of adding the \"cost\" ($27) to the \"refund\" ($3).\n",

      "*   **$2:** Held by the bellboy (the amount he kept).\n",
      "*   **$3:** Held by the three guests ($1 each in their pockets).\n",
      "*   **Total: $25 + $2 + $3 = $30.** \n",
      "Nothing is missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. The Fallacy in the Riddle\n",

The riddle incorrectly adds the bellboy's $2 to the $27 paid by the guests, creating a mathematically irrelevant number ($29). To solve the puzzle, we simply need to track the original $30 using two balance methods:\\n\\n1. The Distribution Method (Where is the money now?):\\n- $25 is in the hotel's register.\\n- $2 is in the bellboy's pocket.\\n- $3 is in the guests' pockets ($1 each).\\n- Total: $25 + $2 + $3 = $30. \\nEverything is accounted for.\\n\\n2. The Net Expenditure Method (What did the guests pay?):\\nThe guests paid $30 and got $3 back, meaning they spent exactly $27. \\n- $25 of that $27 went to the hotel room cost.\\n- $2 of that $27 went to the bellboy as a tip.\\n- Total: $25 + $2 = $27.\\n\\nThe error in the riddle is adding the $2 to the $27. Because the $2 is already part of the $27, adding them together double-counts the bellboy's tip. To get back to the original $30, you must add the $27 spent to the $3 refund ($27 + $3 = $30).
