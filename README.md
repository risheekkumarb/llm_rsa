# RSA - Recursive Self-Aggregation


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

RSA implements Recursive Self-Aggregation, a technique for improving LLM
responses by generating multiple candidate answers and iteratively
aggregating them. The algorithm samples k candidates from a pool of M
responses, asks the LLM to synthesize an improved answer, and repeats
this process across multiple loops to converge on higher-quality
outputs.

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure  package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to 
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## How to use

### Basic Usage

Create an RSA instance with your task prompt and call it to run the
aggregation:

``` python
task_prompt = '''Three people check into a hotel room that costs $30. They each contribute $10. 
Later, the manager realizes the room only costs $25 and gives $5 to the bellboy to return. 
The bellboy keeps $2 and gives $1 back to each person. 
So each person paid $9 (total $27), plus the bellboy has $2, which equals $29. 
Where did the extra dollar go?'''
```

``` python
agg_prompt = """Below is a reasoning problem followed by several candidate solutions. 
Your job is to:
1. Carefully analyze each candidate's reasoning step-by-step
2. Identify which candidates make logical errors or arithmetic mistakes  
3. Note which approaches lead to correct reasoning
4. Synthesize the best reasoning into a single, clear, correct solution

Show your work step-by-step, then state your final answer clearly."""
```

``` python
from llm_rsa.core import RSA

# Create RSA instance with a reasoning task
rsa = RSA(
    task_prompt=task_prompt,
    agg_prompt=agg_prompt, 
    M=4,
    k=2,
    loops=3
)

# Run the aggregation
results = rsa.run()
print(f"Generated {len(rsa.history)} total candidates across {rsa.loops} loops")
print('llm response: \n', results[-1].response)
```

``` python
from litellm import completion

# Single direct call (baseline)
response = completion(
    model='openrouter/google/gemini-3-flash-preview',
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": task_prompt}],
    temperature=1.0
)
baseline_answer = response.choices[0].message.content
print("=== BASELINE (single call) ===")
print(baseline_answer)
```

### Configuration Options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `task_prompt` | (required) | The main task/question to solve |
| `model` | `'openrouter/google/gemini-3-flash-preview'` | LLM model to use (any litellm-compatible model) |
| `M` | 8 | Number of candidates generated per loop |
| `k` | 4 | Number of candidates sampled for each aggregation |
| `loops` | 3 | Number of aggregation iterations |
| `temperature` | 1.0 | LLM sampling temperature |
| `n_workers` | 4 | Parallel workers for LLM calls |
| `agg_prompt` | (auto) | Custom aggregation prompt (optional) |

### How RSA Works

1.  **Loop 0**: Generate M independent responses to the task prompt
2.  **Loop 1+**: For each of M new candidates, randomly sample k
    previous candidates and ask the LLM to aggregate them into an
    improved answer
3.  **Repeat** for the specified number of loops
4.  **Return** the final pool of aggregated candidates

The `history` attribute stores all candidates across all loops, allowing
you to trace the aggregation process.
